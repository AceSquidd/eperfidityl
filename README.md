# eperfidityl

This is a Repository for my Minecraft World named "EPerfidityL", as backup, syncronization and progress tracking. 


This world is originally created on the 12 of march 2024, on minecraft version 1.20.2, with the objective of being a long lasting, technical, "vanilla" (see the mods section), singleplayer minecraft world. 

I have playied minceraft since i was 12, and now that i am 19, studying at EPFL, and with much more experience, I wanted to start a new adventure. This world is trying to puch minecraft and my abilities at their max. I have already did some preatty interesting minecraft worlds (big farms, perimeters and so on), but with this i want to go the extra mile. 

# Rules
We will use some client side mods, like litematica or tweakeroo, and carpet for serverside, but without using game changing features (like sbstack or huskdropsand, nothing that changes vanilla behaviour. I will however use bots). It goes without saying no cheating, however the line is not that well defined: no cheating means no commands that cannot be used in survival, no gamemode changes, no modoficiation of files (change of drop reates or modification of inventory content). I will exploit game bugs, however. Bedrock breaking, update suppression, gravity block duplication are allowed. I will also downgrade the world to 1.14.2 to get god armor, when the time will come.
